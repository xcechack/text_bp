System Perun manages user identities, virtual organizations and their access to services.
It consists of several components and one of them is called Perun Engine, which manages
propagation of changes in Perun world to particular services. The main functionalities
of Engine is to generate scripts that contain required changes and to send those scripts 
to destinations. Engine uses external implementations for executing its tasks and due to
this procedure the internal processes of Engine became invisible and unaccessible. The 
aim of this thesis is to design interface which allows monitoring of those processes which
are executed in Engine. The new monitoring interface will also be able to get information
about the whole organization of execution. That means that Engine will be able to provide
information about running, waiting and finished tasks in any time. The main benefit of this
thesis is a significant rise of information, which we can get from Engine. This makes Engine
more synoptic and potential mistakes and errors in Engine could be caught more easily.
